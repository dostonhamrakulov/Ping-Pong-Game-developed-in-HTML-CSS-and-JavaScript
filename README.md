# Ping-Pong-Game
Game developed on HTML and JavaScript in order to play Ping Pong. It includes the main page (index.html) to select the play mode, the logic to play de game inside each file HTML (alone in "ping.html" or against your computer in "multiplayer.html"), sounds and an optional mode ("ping&bricks.html" and "custom.html" were designed for a class, you can omit it). 

## Play the game
Open the main page in your preferred browser, select 1 option and it will start the game. In the classic game "ping.html", you move the stick with the arrows (up, down) and the computer will try to win you (if you selected vs AI computer), so watch it out.
